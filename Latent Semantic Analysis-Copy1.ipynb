    "# Latent Semantic Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "One natural language processing (NLP) method I've always found interesting is latent semantic analysis (LSA), an early  method that uses matrix decomposition to discover unobserved \"latent\" semantic associations between words in different documents. In this project, I want to use this method to construct an index for a particular work. This was inspired by Cosma Shalizi's data analysis book, in which he discusses using latent semantic indexing (LSI) to construct an index in Adam Smith's \"The Wealth of Nations.\" First, we import the modules we will need. The `gensim` library contains import modules for topic modelling, including the `LsiModel`. \n"

Similarly, the columns are the right singular vectors of $A$, or the eigenvectors of $A^TA$. These two matrices can be used to eigendecompose the matrices $AA^T$ or $A^TA$. The idea behind LSI is that, once we have the SVD decomposition of $X$, we can find a lower dimensional representation of the matrix by truncating the singular values to only keep the $k$ largest ones. It is a well-known theorem that this produces the best rank-$k$ approximation to the original matrix (measured in terms of the Frobenius norm). \n",

The original LSI paper recommends using between 50-100 factors (Deerwester et. al. 1990, p. 7). In this case, we use 50 singular vectors to truncate the SVD. The module `sklearn` has a fast truncated SVD decomposition in the `TruncatedSVD` class.\n",

Then we take the query word (or \"pseudo-document\" in the language of (Deerwester et. al. 1990)) and transform it into the $k$-dimensional space of latent concepts. Once we have done that, we calculate the similarity between every document to every other document, represented in this space. Finally, we can see which documents are most similar to our query. We print the top 20 most similar documents."

That to their colonies is carried on in their own, and is\\nmuch greater, on account of the great riches and extent of those\\ncolonies. But it has never introduced any considerable manufac-\\ntures for distant sale into either of those countries, and the greater\\npart of both still remains uncultivated. The foreign commerce of\\nPortugal is of older standing than that of any great country in\\nEurope, except Italy.\\nItaly is the only great country of Europe which seems to have\\nbeen cultivated and improved in every part, by means of foreign\\ncommerce and manufactures for distant sale. Before the invasion\\nof Charles VIII., Italy, according to Guicciardini, was cultivated\\nnot less in the most mountainous and barren parts of the country,\\nthan in the plainest and most fertile. The advantageous situation\\nof the country, and the great number of independent status which\\nat that time subsisted in it, probably contributed not a little to this\\ngeneral cultivation. It is not impossible, too, notwithstanding this\\ngeneral expression of one of the most judicious and reserved of\\nmodern historians, that Italy was not at that time better cultivated\\nthan England is at present.\\nThe capital, however, that is acquired to any country by com-\\nmerce and manufactures, is always a very precarious and uncer-tain possession, till some part of it has been secured and realized\\nin the cultivation and improvement of its lands. A merchant, it\\nhas been said very properly, is not necessarily the citizen of any\\nparticular country. It is in a great measure indifferent to him from\\nwhat place he carries on his trade; and a very trifling disgust will\\nmake him remove his capital, and, together with it, all the indus-\\ntry which it supports, from one country to another. No part of it\\ncan be said to belong to any particular country, till it has been\\nspread, as it were, over the face of that country, either in buildings,\\nor in the lasting improvement of lands. No vestige now remains of\\nthe great wealth said to have been possessed by the greater part of\\nthe Hanse Towns, except in the obscure histories of the thirteenth\\nand fourteenth centuries.
