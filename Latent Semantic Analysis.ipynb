    "# Latent Semantic Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "One NLP method I've always found interesting is latent semantic analysis (LSA), an early NLP method that uses matrix decomposition to discover unobserved \"latent\" semantic associations between words in different documents. In this project, I want to use this method to construct an index for a particular work. This was inspired by Cosma Shalizi's data analysis book, in which he discusses using LSI to construct an index in Adam Smith's \"The Wealth of Nations.\" I was unable to find the edition of the work he uses, so I employ a slightly different but related book: Karl Marx's \"Capital, Volume I.\"  \n",

In the spirit of the original paper, we look at a pure \"count\" matrix that measures the number of times each word appears in each document (which in this project is a page of the text). Alternatively, we could use a term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) matrix, which in addition to counts incorporates how frequently a word appears across the corpus. We instantiate a `CountVectorizer` object that eliminates English language stop words and then construct the count matrix $X$. We don't do any other sort of processing like stemming words. We will see that even with very basic processing, we can get interesting results."

Similarly, the columns are the right singular vectors of $A$, or the eigenvectors of $A^TA$. These two matrices can be used to eigendecompose the matrices $AA^T$ or $A^TA$. The idea behind LSI is that, once we have the SVD decomposition of $X$, we can find a lower dimensional representation of the matrix by truncating the singular values to only keep the $k$ largest ones. It is a well-known theorem that this produces the best rank-$k$ approximation to the original matrix (measured in terms of the Frobenius norm). \n",

The original LSI paper recommends using between 50-100 factors (Deerwester et. al. 1990, p. 7). In this case, we use 75 singular vectors to truncate the SVD. The module `sklearn` has a fast truncated SVD decomposition in the `TruncatedSVD` class."
